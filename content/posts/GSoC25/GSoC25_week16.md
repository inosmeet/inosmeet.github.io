type: "post"

### Summary

This week was all about building momentum. I successfully recovered from the
data loss by re-implementing the backend-aware architecture for `git pack-refs`.
With that back on track, I also developed and submitted a brand new subcommand,
`git refs get`, to provide a safer way to read ref values in scripts.

### What I Worked On

After the OS crash detailed in my last post, my first priority was to rewrite
the code for the `pack-refs` optimization logic. I'm happy to report that I
successfully implemented the backend-aware architecture we had discussed.

This new design introduces a generic `refs_optimize` API. It intelligently
detects the ref backend being used by the repository and dispatches the call to
the appropriate function. For example, in a standard repository using the `files`
backend, it packs loose refs. However, in a repository using the `reftable`
backend, it will instead perform a compaction of the tables.

To serve as the modern, user-facing entry point for this new logic, I also
introduced the `git refs optimize` command. With the full implementation
complete, I've sent the revised patch series to the mailing list for review.

With the optimize work back on schedule, I met with my mentor to discuss the
next command for consolidation. He suggested creating a new plumbing command,
`git refs get`, to solve some long-standing issues with scripting. Currently,
scripters rely on commands like `git rev-parse` or `git show-ref`, but they have
drawbacks:

- `git rev-parse` can be unpredictable because it performs "Do What I Mean"
  (DWIM) expansion on short names.

- `git show-ref --verify` is hard to discover and can't read the direct value of a
  symbolic ref (like `HEAD`) without resolving it to an object ID.

The new `git refs get <ref>` command solves this. It requires an exact, full
refname and provides a clean, predictable way to read its direct value. For a
symbolic ref like `HEAD`, it will print `ref: refs/heads/main`, and for a direct
ref, it will print the `object ID`. I implemented this new subcommand, complete
with documentation and tests, and sent the patch out for review.

### What's Next

While the official **GSoC** coding period has concluded, my journey with the Git
community is just beginning. My plan is to continue the work I've started:

- I will keep engaging with the mailing list to guide my `pack-refs` optimization
  and `git refs get` patch series through the full review cycle.
- My main goal is to incorporate all feedback and get these features merged
  into Git.
- Looking ahead, I hope to remain an active contributor and continue the `git
  refs` consolidation effort, tackling the next set of commands we've planned.

### Final Thoughts

**Google Summer of Code** has been an incredible and transformative experience.
I've learned an immense amount about the inner workings of **Git**, the process
of collaborative open-source development, and the importance of clear
communication. I'm immensely grateful to my mentors, **Patrick Steinhardt** and
**Jialuo She**, for their constant guidance, insightful reviews, and unwavering
support. I also want to thank **Junio C Hamano** and the entire **Git
community** for being so welcoming and for providing the feedback that helped
shape this project.

It feels great to have brought this project to a successful conclusion. Thank
you for following my journey!
