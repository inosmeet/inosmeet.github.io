### Summary

Weeks 11 and 12 saw continued progress with the submission of the `git refs
exists` patch and the completion of the `git refs optimize` implementation.
However, the timeline was impacted by an unforeseen wrist injury that
temporarily slowed down my work.

### What I Worked On

My first action during this period was to send the prepared patch series for
`git refs exists` to the mailing list for review. I also successfully completed
the coding phase for our next target, `git refs optimize`, which is now
functionally complete.

Unfortunately, my progress was unexpectedly hampered. I strained my wrist while
playing badminton and was unable to type for a while, which meant I couldn't
work on the project. This has caused a delay in my schedule, preventing me from
writing the cover letter and sending the `git refs optimize` patch series as
quickly as I had planned.

I am now recovering and able to get back to the keyboard, and my focus is on
getting back on track with the project goals.

### What's Next

With my wrist feeling better, my plan for the upcoming weeks is to:

- Finalize the cover letter and send the `git refs optimize` patch series to the
  mailing list.
- Actively follow up on mailing list reviews for my submitted patches.
- Discuss the next command for consolidation with my mentors and begin work on
  it.

Happy to be back at the keyboard. Until next time!
