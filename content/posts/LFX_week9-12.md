- [Add tests for microcks' own apis in k6 script](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/pull/1599)
- [Enable health-checks for helm in workflow](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/pull/1617)
- [Add workflow for testing APIs](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/pull/1624)

Over the past few weeks, I extended our `K6` testing suite to cover `Microcks'` own APIs. These
include key endpoints like `authentication`, `/api/features/config`, `/api/keycloak/config`,
`/api/services`, and `/api/jobs`. The tests now verify behavior both with and without authentication
to ensure consistent behavior across access levels.

Next, I wired up `helm` healthchecks into our GitHub Actions CI workflow. Although the script was
already Helm-compatible, this integration ensures that Helm-based installations are now validated as
part of the standard workflow, just like `Docker` and `Podman` setups.

I also added a dedicated workflow that runs the API tests via K6. This includes tests for both
`sample APIs` and `Microcks' APIs`, across four deployment flavors: `uber`, `uber-native`,
`regular-auth`, and `regular-noauth`. One of the trickier parts here was assigning appropriate
scopes to the test user, especially for `regular-auth`, where we needed permission to upload
artifacts. Thanks to guidance from Laurent, that was sorted. Another challenge was that K6 only
exits with an error on `script-level` failures, not on failed checks. To make our CI meaningful, I
implemented a workaround that ensures we fail builds properly when tests fail. Lastly, debugging K6
in CI was quite painful, so I added some helpful debug logs that print on failure to make life
easier.


And that wraps up my final weekly update for LFX! Iâ€™ll be back soon with one last post to reflect on
the full journey, share highlights, and say a proper goodbye. Thanks for following along!
