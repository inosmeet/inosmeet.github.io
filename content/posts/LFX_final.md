# LFX 2025 Term 1 Final Report
- **Name**: Meet Soni ([@inosmeet](https://github.com/inosmeet))
- **Organization**: [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/)
- **Sub-organization**: [Microcks](https://github.com/microcks)
- **Project**: [Improve delivery & validation with GitHub Actions CI deployment tests](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/0c667baa-94bf-405c-ada6-c2bea3bf3e56)
----

### Project Overview
Over the course of this LFX program, my project aimed to enhance the
reliability and quality of Microcks releases by introducing comprehensive
continuous integration (CI) deployment tests and validations using GitHub
Actions. While Microcks already had unit and integration tests, recent
dependency issues and integration bugs highlighted the need for thorough
end-to-end testing.

The goal is to develop automated workflows that simulate real-world deployment
scenarios to catch errors early and ensure that Microcks remains stable and
functional across diverse environments. By doing so, the project addresses
critical needs for preventing regressions and improving confidence in every
Microcks release.

## What stood out to me:

One of the most fulfilling aspects of this experience was the level of trust
and autonomy I was given. Being able to take initiative, experiment, and build
solutions without being micromanaged made the work feel meaningful.

Working with seasoned open-source maintainers gave me a fresh perspective on
how mature projects are maintained and evolved. The mix of guidance and
independence struck the perfect balance.

I want to thank **The Linux Foundation** and **CNCF** for creating a space where
curiosity, collaboration, and learning thrive. Being part of this ecosystem has
been both inspiring and humbling.

A big shoutout to [Laurent Broudoux](https://github.com/lbroudoux). Your mix of
clear guidance and laid-back support made this experience both productive and
fun. This experience wouldn't have been the same without your support.
