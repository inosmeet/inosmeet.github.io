## What did I do?

- [convert mismatch into a standalone utility](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/pull/4300)
- [test: PURL generation for language parsers](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/pull/4332)
- [test: mismatch cli utility](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/pull/4346)
- [docs: mismatch cli utility](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/pull/4348)
- [renamed data directory](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/pull/4356)

These two weeks, I work towards making the mismatch database into a standalone library. I've written tests and documentations for it.

Over the past two weeks, I successfully converted the mismatch database into a standalone CLI utility, making it more accessible and easier to use. Additionally, I implemented
tests for PURL generation across various language parsers and thoroughly tested the new mismatch CLI utility to ensure its reliability. To complement these developments, I
updated the documentation to reflect the changes and provide clear guidance on using the new features. Lastly, I renamed the data directory for improved clarity and 
organization within the project.

## What's coming up next week?

For the upcoming week, I plan to:

- Work on reviews.
- Write the final report.


Signing off for now! Catch ya' next week ;)
